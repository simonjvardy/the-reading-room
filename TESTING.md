  - The Lighthouse 'Best Practices' score was variable due to the 3rd party image  from Waterstones CDN being caught by the 
    Chrome DevTools SameSite cookie policy treating the image links under cross-site cookie settings.

#### Known Bugs ####



#### Unsolved Issues ####

[Issue #27](https://github.com/simonjvardy/alarm-clock/issues/4)
- **Feature: How can the user account be set up as a Super User or Admin?**
  - This is more of a functionality enhancement that an issue.
  - The users documents contain `is_admin` and `is_super_user` flags on each user account. The default is set to 'off'.
  - The usefulness of these flags weren't fully made use of in the app for restricting access to certain functions.
    - Flask-Security may be a better option for creating user role management.

[Issue #51:](https://github.com/simonjvardy/the-reading-room/issues/51)
- **Unit Testing: Favourite button adds same book multiple times**
  - The book page favourite button functionality current doesn't disable the button after a user has clicked the  button once.
  - This means the button could be clicked continuously and keep adding the same favourite book to the users collection document
  - The button styling classes were changed using jQuery on click but this wasn't successfully implemented.
